Main usage: 
stack exec busy-beavers-exe experimentName tacticName chunkSize inputMachines
inputMachines: either a .txt or seed_bit_stateCount or resume 

.txt should contain newline separated machine strings 

seed_bit_stateCount (such as seed_1_4 for the bit 1 and the stateCount 4) 
starts a new run on that machine seed 

resume checks if that experiment already exists, and if so, resumes at the 
last checkpoint


Where stuff is: 
Runner:

  run several tactics in order
