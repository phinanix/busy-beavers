Not MIRI: Turing Machine dumping
To unify two-sided:
First, remove like terms. Then:
If zero vars on either side: must match exactly or fail
Exactly one var on each side: each term unifies to the sum of the non-var parts plus a var
Eg x+5 and y+a unify to 5+a+z
x and y+5 unify to 5+z
One var on only one side: unifies to the other side exactly
x and a+b unify to a+b
[10:25 AM]
One var to a multiple: unifies if the other side is divisible:
kx unifies with 3k but not 2k+1
[10:28 AM]
One var per side  to multiples:
Vars unify to one var times GCD, constant on one side must be divisible by coefficient on other side
3x and 5y unify to 15z
2x + 3 and 3y + 6a unify to 6z + 3 + 6a via x-> 3z + 3a, y-> 2z + 1
